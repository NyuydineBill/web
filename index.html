                <div style="font-size: x-small; color:black;">
                  <p>This course was inspired by the challenges I 
                    faced as a young woman who was desperate to 
                    escape the scorns of a patriarchal society that 
                    makes it hard for a dependent woman to truly 
                    enjoy the beauties of life.</p>
                  <p>At the age of 16, I lost my father to a ghastly 
                    motor accident. In 2009, I went into the 
                    corporate world and always had a side business 
                    to complement my income and responsibilities.
                    </p>
                  <p>I hold a diploma in banking and Finance, A BSc in Accounting, finance and 
                    Audit, An MBA in Global business and I also have 12 years of corporate work 
                    experience across different industries.</p>
                  <p>In 2017, I resigned from my job as finance manager for a multinational 
                    company and took time off to obtain my MBA in global business. During 
                    that time, I worked part time whilst earning some extra income on the 
                    side.</p>
                  <p>When covid 19 hit and the lockdowns were imposed, I went from a state of 
                    confusion and depression from being confined with 2 small children, to 
                    creating over 5 different sources of income.</p>
                  <p>My journey to achieving becoming Ms independent who enjoys financial 
                    freedom and a balanced life, although bumpy, has been incredibly 
                    rewarding.</p>
                  <p>Getting out of my own head and overcoming my limiting beliefs led me to 
                    the place where I have always wanted to be — a happy mother who 
                    spends plenty of time with her kids, offering as much love as I could 
                    possibly give to my partner, whilst living a purposeful and financially free 
                    life.</p>
                  <p><strong>Between November 2020 and December 2022, I have transformed my 
                    $2500 seed capital into just over $ 120,000 from home and mostly using 
                    my mobile phone. And the cherry on the cake is being a happier mum 
                    and partner.
                    </strong></p>
                  <p><strong>I now have more than 5 sources of income and I am continuously 
                    building on that.
                    </strong></p>
                  <p>I wholeheartedly believe that with your participation and action, you will 
                    start to experience success as a business owner within a short span of 
                    time.

            <h2><b>Quotes</b></h2>
            <p>“A queen-conscious woman is one who depends on no one but herself for 
              her financial needs, and her partner’s money is just an addition to what 
              she’s got”
              </p>
              <p>“The secret ingredient to finding balance as an independent 
                woman is taking responsibility for your life’s objectives and 
                steering them in the right direction without seeking permission 
                from anyone”</p>
            <p>"Life is too short. Don't waste another day of it leaving a life that you abosulutely hate!"<br><strong>~Coach Syl Tamanda</strong></p>
